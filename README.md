# Postal System (PS)
> *Postal System (PS) is a versatile and robust email service designed to simplify and enhance your email communication.*

---
This project is a **Postal System (PS)** built using **core Java**. and is a Java Web Application designed to send email notifications to recipients via the provided inputs. It exposes **SOAP** web services.

## Project Structure

This `README.md` gives an overview of the project structure, dependencies, and instructions on how to build and deploy the application.

## Features

1. **Postmaster**: The core logic that prepares and send email based on user input.
2. **SOAP Web Service**: Exposes a `sendEmail` method.
3. **JSP Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface.

## Getting Started

![Project Codes & Tasks.!](/img/code.jpg "Project Codes and Task")

---

### Prerequisites

>- **Apache TomEE 10**: Make sure TomEE is installed and running.
>- **Java 23**: Ensure you have Java 23 installed as TomEE 10 targets Jakarta EE 10.
>- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management with any IDE of choice.

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are defined in `pom.xml`. Below are the key dependencies:

- **Jakarta EE 10 API**: Provides JAX-WS support.
- **JAX-WS**: For SOAP web service implementation.

### Building and Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aerosimo/postalsystem.git
    cd postalsystem
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Deploy the WAR file**:

   After building the project, deploy the generated `WAR` file from the `target/` directory into the `webapps/` folder of your TomEE installation.

4. **Start TomEE**:

   Start TomEE and access the application:

    - SOAP Service: WSDL at `http://localhost:8081/postalsystem/ws/postalsystem?wsdl`
    - Web Interface: `http://localhost:8081/postalsystem/index.jsp`

## Detailed Explanation of Components

### 1. **Connect**

Located in `com/aerosimo/ominet/core/Connect.java`, this is a simple java class that acquires the Session for Postal System based on the settings available on the application server without exposing the mail credentials in the code.

### 2. **Postmaster** (Core Logic)

Located in `com/aerosimo/ominet/models/Postmaster.java`, this is a simple java class that implements the logic of what to send and if send with attachments or not.

### 3. **SOAP Web Service** (JAX-WS)

The SOAP web service is implemented in `com/aerosimo/ominet/api/PostalSystemSOAPService.java`. It provides the following methods:
- `sendMail(String emailAddress, String emailSubject, String emailMessage, String emailFiles)`: Send email to the provided address.

Example SOAP Request for `sendMail`:
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope" xmlns:mail="https://aerosimo.com/api/ws/postmaster">
   <soap:Header/>
   <soap:Body>
      <mail:sendEmail>
         <emailAddress>elijah@aerosimo.com</emailAddress>
         <emailSubject>Test Email from PostMan</emailSubject>
         <emailMessage>Hello I am a test email message from Postman Application</emailMessage>
         <emailFiles />
      </mail:sendEmail>
   </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
